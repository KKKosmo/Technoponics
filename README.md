The software part of my bachelor dissertation. I made an arduino program that can automate the machine functions, store data in an SD card and a MySQL database, view and download data through a webapp, send notifications through e-mail, and save and load machine settings from the SD card storage.

It has 2 separate web applications, online and local. Online for remote monitoring, and local for most of the functions, but has limited css due to few arduino resources.
